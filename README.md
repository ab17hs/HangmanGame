HangmanGame

1. Project Overview
HangmanGame is a simple, mobile-based word guessing game designed for casual players. Players attempt to guess a hidden word by selecting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to “hanging” the character. The game ends when the word is correctly guessed or the player runs out of attempts. The app uses a clean and intuitive interface, suitable for quick, casual play.

2. Target Audience
Casual mobile gamers (students / young adults)
- Players looking for a short, fun game to pass time
- Comfortable using mobile phones for light entertainment
- Prefer simple, intuitive gameplay without complex rules

3. User Profiles

User Profile 1 — “Alice, 20, Student”
- Wants: Play a quick game during breaks
- Needs: Simple controls, clear feedback, low learning curve
- Behaviors: Plays on mobile phone, prefers short sessions

User Profile 2 — “Bob, 22, Part-time worker”
- Wants: Challenge himself with word puzzles
- Needs: Score tracking, clear win/lose feedback
- Behaviors: Plays casually after work, expects intuitive design

4. User Requirements
1. Users can start a new game with a single tap
2. Users can select letters to guess the hidden word
3. The game provides immediate feedback for correct/incorrect guesses
4. A visual representation shows remaining attempts
5. Users are notified of win or loss at game end
6. Scores are tracked per session
